notes: |
  Betweenness centrality identifies nodes that act as bridges
  between different parts of the network.

  High betweenness = critical chokepoint
  - If this facility fails, many routes are disrupted
  - Good candidate for redundancy investment

  Centrality types available:
  - degree: Most connections (fast, local measure)
  - betweenness: Bridge nodes (slower, global measure)
  - closeness: Best average access (medium)
  - pagerank: Importance by incoming links (medium)

  WARNING: Loads entire graph into memory.
  Only suitable for networks under MAX_NODES (10,000).
