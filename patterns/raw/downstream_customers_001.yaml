notes: |
  Opposite of upstream traversal - finds who receives goods
  from this supplier, and recursively their customers.

  For tier 3 suppliers, this traces the path through
  tier 2 -> tier 1 -> final assembly.

  Use cases:
  - Customer concentration risk
  - Supply chain visibility
  - Tracing product flow
