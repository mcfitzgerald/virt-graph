notes: |
  Uses Dijkstra's algorithm via NetworkX.
  Handler uses bidirectional search to minimize nodes loaded.

  Weight column selection from ontology:
  - cost_usd: For cheapest route
  - distance_km: For shortest distance
  - transit_time_hours: For fastest route

  The same pattern works for all three weight types,
  just change weight_col parameter.

  Graph loaded incrementally - only nodes reachable from
  start/end within max_depth are loaded into memory.
