notes: |
  Connected components analysis identifies:
  1. Isolated clusters that can't reach each other
  2. Isolated nodes with no connections
  3. Network fragmentation

  Use cases:
  - Verify network is fully connected
  - Find facilities that need new routes
  - Identify redundancy gaps

  Returns weakly connected components for directed graphs
  (ignores edge direction for connectivity).

  For our test data, expect mostly connected network
  with possibly a few isolated facilities.
