"""
Data Generation Module - Performance-optimized utilities for FMCG data generation.

This module provides foundational classes for the O(N) refactor of generate_data.py.
See robust-frolicking-coral.md for the full performance architecture plan.

Phase 1 - Foundation Classes:
- StaticDataPool: Pre-generated Faker data for O(1) vectorized sampling
- LookupIndex: Generic O(1) lookup index for grouped data
- LookupBuilder: Factory for building lookup indices from row dicts

Phase 2 - Streaming Validation Architecture:
- StreamingWriter: Memory-efficient streaming output with FK-aware management
- DependencyTracker: FK dependency graph for safe table memory purging
- RealismMonitor: Online streaming validation with O(1) space algorithms
- StochasticMode: Enum for normal vs disrupted distribution modes
- WelfordAccumulator: Online mean/variance computation
- FrequencySketch: Approximate frequency counting
- CardinalityEstimator: Unique element counting
- DegreeMonitor: Network hub concentration tracking

Phase 3 - Bottleneck Elimination:
- LookupCache: Pre-built indices for all FK patterns in generate_data.py
- PooledFaker: Batch Faker sampling wrapper for efficient string generation

Phase 4 - Vectorized Generation:
- POSSalesGenerator: Vectorized POS sales generation (~500K rows)
- OrderLinesGenerator: Vectorized order lines generation (~600K rows)
- ShipmentLegsGenerator: Vectorized shipment legs with delay distributions
- Structured array dtypes and conversion utilities

Phase 5 - Chaos Injection:
- RiskEventManager: Risk event triggering and override configuration
- QuirksManager: Behavioral pathology injection (bullwhip, phantom inventory, etc.)

Phase 6 - Multi-Promo Calendar:
- PromoCalendar: Pre-computed (week, account, sku) -> PromoEffect index
- PromoEffect: Promo effect data for lift/hangover application

Phase 7 - Modular Generators (see effervescent-shimmying-blum.md):
- GeneratorContext: Shared state dataclass passed to all generators
- BaseLevelGenerator: Abstract base class for level-specific generators

Phase B - Constants Package (see effervescent-shimmying-blum.md):
- constants/reference: DIVISIONS, CHANNELS, PRODUCTS, PLANTS, PACKAGING_TYPES
- constants/network: DCS, PORTS, CARRIERS
- constants/materials: INGREDIENTS
- constants/rules: KPI_THRESHOLDS, BUSINESS_RULES
- helpers: create_named_entities, TARGET_ROW_COUNTS
